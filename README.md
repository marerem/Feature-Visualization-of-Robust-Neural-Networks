### Literature review
You can find a literature review in the corresponding folder. There is (should be) a list of the papers we read as well as short descriptions in [`literature-review/README.md`](literature-review/README.md).


### Project Notebook
The code of the project can be found in `project.ipynb` which can be run locally as a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook will download the robust resnet34 model from [Robust.Art](http://robust.art) (~250MB)

### DATA FOLDER
The data folder will generate, populate and maintain itself automagically when you run the notebook. Don't push it on Git please.

**A downloadable version of the generated data is available here :** https://drive.belle-ferme.ch/index.php/s/XdrixzBNbeqtHiS/download/data.zip
